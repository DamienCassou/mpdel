** Summary

MPDel is an Emacs client for [[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]] (MPD), a flexible,
powerful, server-side application for playing music. MPDel provides
playback control, completion-based search within your music database
and current and stored playlist manipulation.

This is a screenshot of the current playlist with the
currently-playing song:

You can navigate your music database and add songs to playlists with a
completion:

[[file:media/ivy-mpdel.png]]

MPDel can show information about the currently playing song or any
other song:

** Installing

Clone this git repository and install [[https://melpa.org/#/ivy][ivy]] (you don't need to use ivy
as Emacs' completion system, just have it installed). I will ask to
get MPDel inside [[http://melpa.org/][melpa]].

You need to install and (quickly) configure an [[https://www.musicpd.org/][MPD server]] if you don't
have any yet. Don't worry, that's simple and you won't regret it.

** Using

Start by adding these lines to your ~init.el~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lib/mpdel")
  (require 'mpdel)
  (mpdel-mode)
  (mpdel-setup)
#+END_SRC

Then, press ~C-x Z p~ to show the current playlist. The ~C-x Z~ global
prefix is configurable with ~mpdel-prefix-key~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mpdel-prefix-key (kbd "C-. z"))
#+END_SRC

*** Adding songs to the current playlist

You can add songs to the playlist by typing ~a~ in the current
playlist or by typing ~C-x Z a~ everywhere in Emacs. At this point,
the minibuffer contains a list of artists in the database. You can add
all songs from any artist by selecting the artist and pressing ~M-o
a~. You can also browse to the artist's albums by typing ~RET~ (i.e.,
~enter~). Add a complete album to the current playlist by typing ~M-o
a~ or go to the album's songs by typing ~RET~. Beyond ~a~ after ~M-o~,
you can type ~r~ (replace whole playlist by selection) or ~P~ (add to
a stored playlist).

*** Global key bindings

Anywhere in Emacs, if you activate ~mpdel-mode~, you have access to
set of key bindings to control your music. The following key bindings
must all be prefixed by ~mpdel-prefix-key~'s value (~C-x Z~ by
default):

| *Binding* | *Action*                     |
|-----------+------------------------------|
| ~SPC~     | play / pause                 |
| ~S~       | display current song         |
| ~a~       | navigate your database       |
| ~p~       | open current playlist        |
| ~l~       | navigate a stored playlist   |
| ~P~       | open a stored playlist       |
| ~]~       | start playing next song      |
| ~[~       | start playing previous song  |
